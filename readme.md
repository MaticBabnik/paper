# Paper

Wallpaper? I hardly even know her!

## Todo

- [x] static output group definitions (jsonc)
- [ ] fixup WallpaperImage error handling and add cache
- [ ] dynamic wallpaper and spantype changes over DBus or normal socket (json messages)
- [ ] split into daemon and cli
- [ ] Come up with a new name (`paper` is too generic and seems to be used by libpaper)
- [ ] package for arch
